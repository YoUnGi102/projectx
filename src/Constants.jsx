And who or what should receive the object?· Finally, the actors of the conflict axis are uncovered: What resistance can the subject expect to meet? And what kind of help is needed to overcome this resistance? · Make an actant model of the current situation and follow up with potential scenarios. Worth considering · Test narrative scenarios by rotating an actor in different actant positions. · Do not just elaborate on the actants. Also describe the content of the relationships. Preparation Print many templates in A3 for the groups. The use of the Actant Model requires many repetitions.

      "The actant model (Greimas, 1973) is traditionally used to examine and describe relationships, functions and actions in a storytelling. However, the model can also be an effective tool for initiating development processes through narrative scenarios. The special strength of the actant model is that it acts as a checklist of projects’ key actors and at the same time creates a coherent  picture of relationships, functions and possible actions. In short, the actant model can be used as a tool for identifying possible  development strategies, project planning and communication.  The actant model consists of 6 roles, which are called actants: · Subject - Who is the “main character” · Object - The subject always has a project, a goal or something he / she wants to grasp. · Opponent - Who or what is trying to prevent the subject from reaching the object? · Helper - Who or what helps the subject get the object? · Giver - Who or what gives away the object? · Recipient - Who or what gets the object in the end?",
